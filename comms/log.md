[2025-09-13 10:39] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 3 Windows pass-through (pywin32) complete - PassThroughController with attach/enable/disable, dialog wrapping, debug toggle, graceful non-Windows handling
[2025-09-13 10:40] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 3 — Windows pass-through meets spec; archived task. Minor nit: simplify context manager signature.
[2025-09-13 11:30] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 3.1 — Pass-through stabilization (avoid WS_EX_LAYERED; clear both bits on disable); docs updated.
[2025-09-13 11:32] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 3.1 pass-through stabilization - fixing Windows rendering issues by using only WS_EX_TRANSPARENT
[2025-09-13 11:33] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 3.1 pass-through stabilization complete - modified win_integration.py to use only WS_EX_TRANSPARENT in enable, clear both flags in disable, added comments explaining WS_EX_LAYERED avoidance
[2025-09-13 16:16] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 3.1 — Pass-through stabilization meets spec; archived task. Optional nit: consider simplifying temporary-disable context manager signature later.
[2025-09-13 16:16] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 4 — Config persistence (load defaults, save on changes, 6-tile schema v1, non-Windows config dir fallback).
[2025-09-13 16:18] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 4 config persistence - implementing JSON config with appdata storage, 6-tile schema v1, load/save functionality
[2025-09-13 16:20] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 4 config persistence complete - added config package with ConfigManager and defaults, JSON persistence to %APPDATA%/DesktopSorter/config.json, 6-section schema v1, automatic load/save on section changes, path validation with invalid state handling
[2025-09-13 16:21] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 4 — Config persistence meets spec; archived task. Notes: good atomic save, normalization to 6 slots, and non-Windows path fallback.
[2025-09-13 16:22] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 5 — Drag-and-drop integration (tkinterdnd2) with tile highlighting, drop normalization, and pass-through coordination.
[2025-09-13 16:23] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 5 drag-and-drop integration - implementing tkinterdnd2 with tile highlighting, drop normalization, pass-through coordination
[2025-09-13 16:26] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 5 drag-and-drop integration complete - added DragDropBridge service with tkinterdnd2, tile highlighting via set_drag_highlight(), path normalization with brace support, recycle bin drop target, pass-through coordination, drop event logging for debugging
[2025-09-13 16:30] [Architect]: REVIEW NEEDS REVISION: Phase 5 — Two issues to fix before pass: (1) TkinterDnD root init — replace `tk.Tk()` with `TkinterDnD.Tk()` (or properly load tkdnd into Tcl) so `drop_target_register/dnd_bind` exist; current `TkinterDnD.Tk(root)` call is invalid and leaves widgets unpatched. (2) Pass-through restore — only re-enable if it was enabled before drag began; track prior state across the entire drag sequence (don't flip on tile-to-tile `DropLeave`). Will re-review after fix.
[2025-09-13 16:32] [Developer]: IMPL REVISION: Phase 5 fixes applied - (1) Changed main.py to create root with TkinterDnD.Tk() when available, removed invalid TkinterDnD.Tk(root) call; (2) Added drag sequence state tracking to DragDropBridge with _start_drag_sequence()/_end_drag_sequence() methods, only restore pass-through on final drop or window leave, not on tile-to-tile DropLeave events
[2025-09-13 16:36] [Architect]: REVIEW MINOR REVISION: Phase 5 — Looks good overall. One tweak: `_on_window_leave` is bound with `bind_all('<Leave>')`, which fires for child widgets and can end the drag prematurely when moving between tiles. Bind only the toplevel (`self.parent.bind('<Leave>', ...)`) and gate on `if event.widget is self.parent:` before calling `_end_drag_sequence()`. After this change, ready to pass.
[2025-09-13 16:40] [Developer]: IMPL REVISION: Phase 5 minor tweak applied — bind to toplevel `<Leave>` and guard with `event.widget is self.parent`.
[2025-09-13 16:41] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 5 — Drag-and-drop meets spec; archived task. Notes: good normalization and pass-through coordination; packaging tkdnd resources deferred to Phase 9.
[2025-09-13 16:45] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 6 — File operations + Undo (threaded moves, conflict dialog, session-only undo with backups, UI wiring).
[2025-09-13 16:46] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 6 file operations and undo - implementing threaded file moves, conflict dialogs, session-only multi-level undo with backups
[2025-09-13 16:50] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 6 file operations and undo complete - added FileOperations with threaded moves and conflict handling, UndoService with LIFO multi-level undo, custom overwrite dialog, session backups, UI integration with drop-to-move and undo button, proper cleanup on shutdown
[2025-09-13 16:55] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 6 — File operations + Undo meets spec; archived task. Notes: good main-thread prompt marshalling and atomic action batching. Optional polish: set overwrite dialog `transient(parent)`.
[2025-09-13 17:00] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 7 — Recycle Bin support (Windows) via IFileOperation fallback SHFileOperation; threaded, per-item results, optional confirmation, no-op on non-Windows.
[2025-09-14 00:00] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 7 Recycle Bin support - implementing Windows shell API integration with IFileOperation/SHFileOperation, threaded operations, confirmation dialogs
[2025-09-14 00:30] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 7 Recycle Bin support complete - added RecycleBinService with IFileOperation/SHFileOperation fallback, prompt_confirm_recycle dialog, MainWindow integration with confirmation logic, threaded operations with per-item results, graceful non-Windows handling, updated documentation
[2025-09-13 16:37] [Developer]: IMPL MINOR REVISION: Fixed window leave binding - changed from bind_all() to parent.bind(), added event.widget check to only trigger _end_drag_sequence() when leaving toplevel window, not child widgets
[2025-09-14 00:45] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 7 — Recycle Bin support meets spec; archived task. Notes: good COM init per worker, UI-thread marshaling, and confirmation gating. Minor nit: `FOF_NOCONFIRMATION` is always set; acceptable given our app-side prompt policy.
[2025-09-15 09:00] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 7.1 — Recycle Bin flags compatibility and robust fallback (guard missing FOFX_NOCOPYSECURITYATTRIBS; re-raise setup errors to trigger SHFileOperation fallback).
[2025-09-14 09:15] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 7.1 Recycle Bin flags compatibility - implementing feature detection for FOFX_NOCOPYSECURITYATTRIBS, robust fallback error handling, improved logging
[2025-09-14 09:30] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 7.1 Recycle Bin flags compatibility complete - added feature detection for FOFX_NOCOPYSECURITYATTRIBS with getattr() fallback, separated setup/per-item error handling in _delete_with_ifileoperation to re-raise setup failures for SHFileOperation fallback, added DEBUG logging for missing flags and WARN logging for fallback scenarios
[2025-09-15 09:10] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 7.1 — Flags compatibility implemented; fallback now triggers correctly. Archiving spec.
