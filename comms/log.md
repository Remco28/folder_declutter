[2025-09-12 18:45] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 2 meets spec; archived task. Minor nits noted.
[2025-09-12 18:55] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 2.1 — UI polish and robustness.
[2025-09-12 18:56] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 3 — Windows pass-through (pywin32).
[2025-09-12 18:40] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 2 UI scaffold with 2×3 grid, Undo button, section management
[2025-09-12 18:45] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 2 UI scaffold complete - 2×3 grid, section tiles with add/edit/remove, Undo button (disabled), tooltips, context menus. Ready for Windows testing.
[2025-09-13 10:32] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 2.1 — UI polish and robustness meets spec; archived task. Optional note: theme border consistency.
[2025-09-13 10:26] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 2.1 UI polish and robustness improvements
[2025-09-13 10:28] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 2.1 UI polish and robustness complete - package structure, tooltip fixes, theme-friendly visuals, reliable keyboard bindings
[2025-09-13 10:36] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 3 Windows pass-through (pywin32) implementation
[2025-09-13 10:39] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 3 Windows pass-through (pywin32) complete - PassThroughController with attach/enable/disable, dialog wrapping, debug toggle, graceful non-Windows handling
[2025-09-13 10:40] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 3 — Windows pass-through meets spec; archived task. Minor nit: simplify context manager signature.
[2025-09-13 11:30] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 3.1 — Pass-through stabilization (avoid WS_EX_LAYERED; clear both bits on disable); docs updated.
[2025-09-13 11:32] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 3.1 pass-through stabilization - fixing Windows rendering issues by using only WS_EX_TRANSPARENT
[2025-09-13 11:33] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 3.1 pass-through stabilization complete - modified win_integration.py to use only WS_EX_TRANSPARENT in enable, clear both flags in disable, added comments explaining WS_EX_LAYERED avoidance
[2025-09-13 16:16] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 3.1 — Pass-through stabilization meets spec; archived task. Optional nit: consider simplifying temporary-disable context manager signature later.
[2025-09-13 16:16] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 4 — Config persistence (load defaults, save on changes, 6-tile schema v1, non-Windows config dir fallback).
[2025-09-13 16:18] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 4 config persistence - implementing JSON config with appdata storage, 6-tile schema v1, load/save functionality
[2025-09-13 16:20] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 4 config persistence complete - added config package with ConfigManager and defaults, JSON persistence to %APPDATA%/DesktopSorter/config.json, 6-section schema v1, automatic load/save on section changes, path validation with invalid state handling
[2025-09-13 16:21] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 4 — Config persistence meets spec; archived task. Notes: good atomic save, normalization to 6 slots, and non-Windows path fallback.
[2025-09-13 16:22] [Architect]: SPEC READY: Phase 5 — Drag-and-drop integration (tkinterdnd2) with tile highlighting, drop normalization, and pass-through coordination.
[2025-09-13 16:23] [Developer]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 5 drag-and-drop integration - implementing tkinterdnd2 with tile highlighting, drop normalization, pass-through coordination
[2025-09-13 16:26] [Developer]: IMPL DONE: Phase 5 drag-and-drop integration complete - added DragDropBridge service with tkinterdnd2, tile highlighting via set_drag_highlight(), path normalization with brace support, recycle bin drop target, pass-through coordination, drop event logging for debugging
[2025-09-13 16:30] [Architect]: REVIEW NEEDS REVISION: Phase 5 — Two issues to fix before pass: (1) TkinterDnD root init — replace `tk.Tk()` with `TkinterDnD.Tk()` (or properly load tkdnd into Tcl) so `drop_target_register/dnd_bind` exist; current `TkinterDnD.Tk(root)` call is invalid and leaves widgets unpatched. (2) Pass-through restore — only re-enable if it was enabled before drag began; track prior state across the entire drag sequence (don't flip on tile-to-tile `DropLeave`). Will re-review after fix.
[2025-09-13 16:32] [Developer]: IMPL REVISION: Phase 5 fixes applied - (1) Changed main.py to create root with TkinterDnD.Tk() when available, removed invalid TkinterDnD.Tk(root) call; (2) Added drag sequence state tracking to DragDropBridge with _start_drag_sequence()/_end_drag_sequence() methods, only restore pass-through on final drop or window leave, not on tile-to-tile DropLeave events
[2025-09-13 16:36] [Architect]: REVIEW MINOR REVISION: Phase 5 — Looks good overall. One tweak: `_on_window_leave` is bound with `bind_all('<Leave>')`, which fires for child widgets and can end the drag prematurely when moving between tiles. Bind only the toplevel (`self.parent.bind('<Leave>', ...)`) and gate on `if event.widget is self.parent:` before calling `_end_drag_sequence()`. After this change, ready to pass.
[2025-09-13 16:40] [Developer]: IMPL REVISION: Phase 5 minor tweak applied — bind to toplevel `<Leave>` and guard with `event.widget is self.parent`.
[2025-09-13 16:41] [Architect]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 5 — Drag-and-drop meets spec; archived task. Notes: good normalization and pass-through coordination; packaging tkdnd resources deferred to Phase 9.
[2025-09-13 16:37] [Developer]: IMPL MINOR REVISION: Fixed window leave binding - changed from bind_all() to parent.bind(), added event.widget check to only trigger _end_drag_sequence() when leaving toplevel window, not child widgets
