# Desktop Sorter File Structure

Below is a proposed file structure for the Desktop Sorter application, designed to keep the codebase organized, maintainable, and aligned with the high-level specification. The app is a standalone Python application for Windows, built with PyInstaller for portability, using Tkinter for the UI, and storing configuration in a JSON file.

## File Structure
```
DesktopSorter/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py                 # Entry point; initializes app and runs main loop
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── window.py          # Manages the floating window, sections, and drag-and-drop
│   │   ├── section.py         # Represents a single section (label, path, UI elements)
│   │   └── dialogs.py         # Handles dialogs (overwrite, folder move, invalid folder)
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── config_manager.py  # Manages reading/writing JSON config for section persistence
│   │   └── defaults.py        # Defines default settings (e.g., Recycle Bin section)
│   └── file_handler/
│       ├── file_operations.py # Handles file/folder moving, name conflict checks
│       └── error_handler.py   # Manages error cases (e.g., invalid folder, permissions)
├── resources/
│   ├── icon.png               # Icon for the minimized floating icon
│   └── default_config.json    # Template JSON config (optional, for first-time setup)
├── dist/

│   └── config.json            # User config file (stored in AppData during runtime)
├── requirements.txt           # Lists dependencies (e.g., tkinter, pywin32 for Windows APIs)
├── README.md                  # Basic app description, usage, and build instructions
├── LICENSE                    # License file (e.g., MIT for a free app)
└── pyinstaller.spec           # PyInstaller configuration for building the standalone .exe
```

## File Descriptions
- **src/main.py**: The main script that initializes the app, sets up the Tkinter root window, and coordinates between UI, config, and file handling modules.
- **src/ui/window.py**: Defines the main floating window, including the grid layout for sections, minimize/restore functionality, and drag-and-drop event handling.
- **src/ui/section.py**: Represents a single section (UI + logic), managing its label, folder path, highlight effect, and edit/delete buttons.
- **src/ui/dialogs.py**: Implements dialog windows for overwrite/cancel, folder move confirmation, and invalid folder prompts.
- **src/config/config_manager.py**: Handles reading/writing section configurations (labels, paths) to a JSON file in the user's AppData folder.
- **src/config/defaults.py**: Stores default settings, such as the Recycle Bin section's path and label.
- **src/file_handler/file_operations.py**: Manages file/folder moving operations, including multi-select drag-and-drop and name conflict resolution.
- **src/file_handler/error_handler.py**: Processes errors like inaccessible folders or permissions issues, triggering appropriate dialogs.
- **resources/icon.png**: A small image (e.g., 32x32px) for the minimized floating icon.
- **resources/default_config.json**: Optional template for initial config setup (e.g., predefining the Recycle Bin section).
- **dist/DesktopSorter.exe**: The compiled standalone executable, generated by PyInstaller for portability.
- **dist/config.json**: The runtime user configuration file, stored in `C:/Users/<User>/AppData/Roaming/DesktopSorter/`.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies (e.g., `pywin32` for Windows-specific drag-and-drop and always-on-top functionality).
- **README.md**: Provides a brief overview, usage instructions, and how to build the app from source.
- **LICENSE**: A simple open-source license (e.g., MIT) for the free app.
- **pyinstaller.spec**: Configuration file for PyInstaller to bundle the app into a single .exe, including resources like the icon.

## Notes
- **Portability**: The `dist/DesktopSorter.exe` is the primary deliverable, requiring no Python installation. The `config.json` is created in AppData at runtime, ensuring the app remains portable.
- **AppData Path**: The config file is stored at `C:/Users/<User>/AppData/Roaming/DesktopSorter/config.json` to comply with Windows conventions and avoid cluttering the user's directory.
- **Modularity**: The structure separates concerns (UI, file operations, config) for easier maintenance and potential future enhancements.
- **Dependencies**: Minimal, likely just `tkinter` (built-in) and `pywin32` for Windows-specific features like drag-and-drop from Explorer.

This structure keeps the project lean while supporting all specified features (floating window, up to 8 sections, drag-and-drop, persistence, error handling). Let me know if you want to adjust anything or dive deeper into a specific module!
